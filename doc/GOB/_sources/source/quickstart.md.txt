# Quickstart

## Using wheel
The easiest way to install GOB is via pip. You can download the latest wheel from the [releases page](https://github.com/gaetanserre/GOB/releases) on GitHub and install it using pip:

```bash
pip install gob-<version>-<architecture>.whl
```

## From source

First, you will need to have a C++ compiler, `make`, `cmake`, and the Eigen library installed on your system.

### Clone the repository
```bash
pip install gob-<version>-<architecture>.whl
```

### Compile and install the package
```bash
cd GOB
pip install .
```
