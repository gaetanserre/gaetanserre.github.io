The first sample is drawn from a probability measure inherent to the algorithm, and subsequent samples are generated based on Markov kernels that depend on the previous samples and their associated evaluations by a continuous function. We define the following structure to represent such an algorithm.\n\n\n\nThe type  is the product type (Iic n → α) × (Iic n → β) which represents the sequence of samples and their evaluations at each iteration. The measure  is the initial probability measure from which the first sample is drawn, and  is the Markov kernel that defines how to sample the next element based on the previous ones.\n\nTo assess the validity of this definition, we encompass three well-known algorithms in the literature into this framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n","context":"Consistency of global optimization algorithms\u0009Stochastic iterative algorithm","header":"1.1.
