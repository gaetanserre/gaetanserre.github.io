We chose to use the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem  to define this measure. The implementation of this theorem in Mathlib is done via the  function, which, given a family of Markov kernels on finite sequences, returns a Markov kernel on infinite sequences.\n\nTo be able to use  with , we need to pullback each kernel in the family along a function that, given a sequence of samples u and a continuous function f, returns (u, f ∘ u). This new kernel is defined using .\n\n\n\nIt allows to define a measure on sequences of size n + 1 by averaging the Ionescu-Tulcea kernel, given by  over the initial measure Algorithm. pulled back along the measurable equivalence between Iic 0 → α and α.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause  is a probability measure, and all kernels  are Markov kernels,  is a also probability measure on sequences of samples.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can define the measure on finite sequences of samples of size n + 1 produced by the algorithm by measuring set of infinite sequences of samples such that the first n + 1 elements are in a set of sequences of size n + 1.\n\n\n\n","context":"Consistency of global optimization algorithms\u0009Stochastic iterative algorithm","header":"1.2.
