At each iteration, it samples k points according to a multivariate normal distribution where the mean and the covariance matrix depend on the previous iterations. Given a continuous function f : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}, we construct \\tilde{f} : \\Omega^k \\to \\mathbb{R}^k by\n\n  \\tilde{f}(x_1, \\dots, x_k) = (f(x_1), \\dots, f(x_k)).\n\nThis new definition lets us view CMA-ES as a procedure that generates samples in \\Omega^k, where \\tilde{f} is employed to construct the transition kernels. The CMA-ES algorithm can be defined as follows:\n\n*  := \\mathcal{N}^{\\otimes k}(\\mu, \\Sigma) is the k-product of multivariate normal measures on the search space \\alpha with mean \\mu and covariance matrix \\Sigma.*  := (X, \\tilde{f}(X)) \\mapsto \\mathcal{N}(\\mu(X, \\tilde{f}(X)), \\Sigma(X, \\tilde{f}(X))) is the Markov kernel that maps any pair of samples/evaluations to the multivariate normal distribution with mean \\mu(X, \\tilde{f}(X)) and covariance matrix \\Sigma(X, \\tilde{f}(X)) adapted based on the previous samples and their evaluations.\n\n","context":"Consistency of global optimization algorithms\u0009Stochastic iterative algorithm\u0009Definition\u0009AdaLIPO","header":"1.1.2.1.
