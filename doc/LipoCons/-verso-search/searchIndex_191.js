Thus, the hypothesis that the sequences of size m + 1 in E are contained in the set of sequences of size m + 1 that are continuations of S means that $E is a subset of all possible continuations of sequences in S. Therefore, the measure of E is less than or equal to the measure of S.\n\n\n\n","context":"Consistency of global optimization algorithms\u0009Stochastic iterative algorithm\u0009Useful properties","header":"1.3.1.
