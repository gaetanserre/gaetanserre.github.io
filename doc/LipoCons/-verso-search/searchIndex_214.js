An algorithm is said to sample the whole search space, given f, if the supremum of the minimum distance between the samples and a point in the search space tends to 0 in probability, i.e.\n\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\min_{0 \\le i \\le n} \\| x - X_i\\| \\xrightarrow{p} 0,\n\nwhere \\| \\cdot \\| denotes a norm on the search space (usually the Euclidean norm), and X_i is the i-th sample produced by the algorithm given f.\n\nThis definition can be unfolded as follows:\n\n\\forall \\varepsilon > 0, \\; \\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\min_{0 \\le i \\le n} \\| x - X_i\\| > \\varepsilon) \\xrightarrow[n \\to \\infty]{} 0,\n\nwhere \\mathbb{P} is equal to Algorithm..\n\nTo formalize this definition, we define the minimum distance between a point in the search space and a sequence of samples.\n\n\n\nAs  is a continuous function, we can define the maximum of this function over the compact search space. Hence, the \\sup in the above definition can be replaced by a \\max over the search space.\n\n\n\nFinally, given a continuous function f, an algorithm A samples the whole search space if the measure of the set of sequences of samples of size n + 1 such that,  is greater than \\varepsilon, tends to 0 when n tends to infinity.\n\n\n\nNow, we have all the definitions needed to formalize the Proposition 3 of .\n\n\n","context":"Consistency of global optimization algorithms\u0009Consistency and sampling","header":"2.2.
